## SOFTWARE PROCESS MODELS 

### What is a software process model?

A software process model is a list of activities that are completed in order to complete the development of a software system. There are two main types of software process models. The first of which is plan driven. A plan driven software process model is when all activities are planned in advanced and systematically completed until the job it done. An agile driven process model is when tasks are completed in stages/groups but are easily changed in order to change to the customers specifications  

**Plan-driven** is best used for systems that need a high safety aspect as detailed records are kept at each stage in the process. 

**Agile-driven** process model is best used for business that constantly need to adapt to change in their plans 

The system process model that our group has decided to go with is a plan-driven. Giving that we are making a payroll system that would have to store the banking details of many students, security is a high priority for our system. Therefore, we believe a plan driven system to best suited for our situation as keeping accurate records is easiest in this format 


The type of plan-driven process model that we are going with is a water fall model. A water-fall model has separate and distinct phases of specification and development. The water fall model has six different phases in order from first to be done to last to be done.

*Requirements analysis – the systems requirements and use are taken from the customers the system is intended for* 

*System design – a basic design of the overall system and how it will be laid out* 

*Implementation – the development of the system and its software start*

*(Unit) testing – testing each unit verifying that all part of the software reaches the needed specification* 

*Deployment - the system is installed and put into practical use*

*Maintenance - involves correcting errors, improving the implementation, and enhancing the system’s services as new requirements are discovered.* 


### Advantages of a water fall model 

- *As it is a plan driven model it is quite simple in its process, meaning it is step by step* 

- *waterfall models are also very reliable for safety critical systems as it is capable of keeping accurate records at each stage*

### Disadvantage of waterfall model

- *Once an application is in the testing stage, it is very difficult to go back and change*  

- *something that was not well-thought out in the concept stage.* 

- *It takes longer to create a working model using plan driven waterfall then the like of an agile process* 

- *The waterfall model does come with high risk as it does not allow for a margin of error as it is such a rigid process model it does not account for mistakes* 

- *Not a good model for business that would require complex system that revolve around change*  

- *Poor model for long and ongoing projects*
